1. dont panic :)
2. inspect first and read the error message..
3. see the code on where the line error is, then try to read the codeflow to 
    search what seems to be the problematic there
4. if still cant find it, google it by copy the message error
5. you can use another tools such as chrome breakpoint to see codeflow
6. or react developer tools chrome extensions, there you can see the component state and
    code exactly at that component.
