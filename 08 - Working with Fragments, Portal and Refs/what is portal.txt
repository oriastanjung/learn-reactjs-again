so basic ly react portals is where we see a bunch of component which not semanticly output
on the page.. such as modal component. since it was modal component, it should 
overlay all other component, so it have to be at the top of the structure.
portals are made to solve this.
first we need to create some portal at index.html on public
then create portal using ReactDOM.createPortal()
see at error modal component
